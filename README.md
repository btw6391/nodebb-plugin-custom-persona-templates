# Plugin to add custom templates to the NodeBB Persona theme

This plugin was created to add custom templates to the Persona theme.

## General Use

This plugin was designed on top of the "Persona" theme and "Paper" skin.

This plugin has not been developed for easy customization/translation but may hopefully serve as an example for those looking to build their own custom  templates.

## Future Improvements

- More customization of the Persona theme

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-custom-persona-templates
